## Technologies Used
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and push it to GitHub. 
2. [GitHub](https://github.com) Used to store the project after it has been pushed from Git.
3. [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) The Bootstrap library was used throughout the project to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website.
4. [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) The project uses Font Awesome icons.
5. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) Google fonts were used to homogenize the project. The font imported to the style.css file was 'Overpass'.
6. [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) Google maps were used to show Dublin in the contact section.
7. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) jQuery was used to make the navbar responsive and also used for the modal dialog.


## Design

* ### Colour Scheme

The colours used are black, orange and shades of grey.

* ### Typography

The Overpass font is used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font. Besides being an attractive clean font, Overpass was appropriate because it's similar to the font "Interstate" used in the SoundCloud code embedded in the Music section. 

* ### Design choices

A reduction of content according to screen size was applied.
On Large screens the user can have access to the full content and enjoy a full experience the website provides.

But with reduction of screen size the content is accordingly reduced to keep providing a good experience on the website without having a confusing and crowded screen.
On a small screen size just 2 videos are shown on Video sections and instead of 6 just 4 music pieces are shown on music section.

Also on small screen size the navigation bar loses the social media links and turns into a button with the menu links to the other sections.


* ### Wireframe.

## Deployment

### Git Commands
After writing the code on Gitpod, I used the Git Commands:

* git add and file or directory name, adds files to the staging area for Git.
* git commit -m "message", record the changes made to the files to a local repository.
* git push, sends local commits to the remote repository on GitHub. 


### GitHub Pages
The deployment was deployed to the GitHub pages.
From my GitHub web page, I open the repository I want to deploy, in this case, “Cau-Correa/ms1”. 
Then at the top right of the page click on the 'Settings' link, and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, 
I selected the master branch as source, click on save, and I was provided with the following 
message: Your site is published at https://cau-correa.github.io/ms1/


### Forking the GitHub Repository

Once you locate the repository you want to fork, at the top right of the page below the right items in the navigation bar the fork button can be located.
Now you should have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone
