        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Ross Nevin is a versatile session musician and recording artist based out of Dublin, Ireland.</p>

        <p>This talented multi-instrumentalist is able to effortlessly deliver quality performances on instruments as diverse as sax, vocals, flute and piano. <br>Ross also writes his own material: "Awake at Night" is the title of his debut EP, a release featuring 4 songs with a sound that falls somewhere in between jazz, progressive and pop. <br>Tracks such as "In The Dust" bridge the gaps between the groove of Miles Davis and the melodic sensibility and folky vibes of Wilco, creating a really unique compromise.
